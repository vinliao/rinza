# rinza notifier

A websocket server that sends real-time Farcaster events.

It currently points to my Neynar Hub: `20eef7.hubs.neynar.com:2283`

A Dockerfile is provided for easy deployment, in case you want to run it on your own Hub.

// TODO: finish this doc, make it easier for anyone to run their own notifier
